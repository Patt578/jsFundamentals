/* 
Booleans
******************
What is a boolean? Boolean can represent: true/false, yes/no, on/off
*/ 
let i = true;
let j = false;
/*        (1)
1-Keyword for boolean - no quotation marks
let on = true;
console.log(on); // true
let off = false;
console.log(off); // false
 */

 /* 
Null
******************
Null = empty value (not 0; not undefined)
It is like an empty container; nothing is in it, but it still exists as a space to fill
*/
let empty = null;
console.log(empty); // null
/*
Undefined
******************
Undefined = no value assigned (not even an empty container)
UNDEFINED IS NOT AN ERROR
*/
let undef = undefined;// never do this
console.log(undef); // undefined
let grass;
console.log(grass); // undefined
/*
Null vs. Undefined 
******************
Null is like a container with nothing in it
Undefined is when a variable has never been set, or hasnt been created yet.
